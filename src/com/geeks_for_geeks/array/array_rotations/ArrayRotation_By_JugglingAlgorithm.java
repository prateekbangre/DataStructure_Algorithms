Rotate an array by K Position left.
1. First of all, divide the array by finding the GCD of d and n where d is the number of elements by which
the array has to be rotated and n is the size of the array.
2. GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) or HCF(Highest Common Factor) of d and n is the number of sets in which
the array has to be divided.
3. Move the elements within these numbers of sets.

Here is an example for n =12 and d = 3. GCD is 3 and
Let arr[] be {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12}

a) Elements are first moved in first set â€“ (See below
   diagram for this movement)
    ArrayRotation
          arr[] after this step --> {4 2 3 7 5 6 10 8 9 1 11 12}

b)    Then in second set.
          arr[] after this step --> {4 5 3 7 8 6 10 11 9 1 2 12}

c)    Finally in third set.
          arr[] after this step --> {4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 1 2 3}

Time complexity : O(n)
