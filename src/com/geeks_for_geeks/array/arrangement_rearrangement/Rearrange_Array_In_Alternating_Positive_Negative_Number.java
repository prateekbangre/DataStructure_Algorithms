An array contains both positive and negative numbers in random order. Rearrange the array elements so that
positive and negative numbers are placed alternatively. Number of positive and negative numbers need not be
equal. If there are more positive numbers they appear at the end of the array. If there are more negative
numbers, they too appear in the end of the array.

For example, if the input array is [-1, 2, -3, 4, 5, 6, -7, 8, 9], then the output should
be [9, -7, 8, -3, 5, -1, 2, 4, 6]
